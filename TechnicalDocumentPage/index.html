            </ul>

            <p>Before a builder can put a shovel in the ground, local government must approve the design and provide
                permits for everything from the zoning and grading (changing the contour of the land to accommodate your
                home and driveway) to the septic systems, home construction, electrical work, and plumbing. Once permits
                are acquired, physical construction can begin.</p>

            <p>Often, site preparation and foundation work are performed by the same crew, but this may not be the case
                with a wooded lot. Using a backhoe and a bulldozer, the crew clears the site of rocks, debris and trees
                for the house and, if applicable, the septic system. The crew levels the site, puts up wooden forms to
                serve as a template for the foundation and digs the holes and trenches. Footings (structures where the
                house interfaces with the earth that supports it) are installed. If your home is going to have a well,
                it will be dug at this point.</p>

            <p>If the home has a full basement, the hole is dug, the footings are formed and poured, and the foundation
                walls are formed and poured. If it’s slab-on-grade, the footings are dug, formed and poured; the area
                between them is leveled and fitted with utility runs (e.g. plumbing drains and electrical chases); and
                the slab is poured.</p>

            <p>Once concrete is poured into the holes and trenches, it will need time to cure. During this period, there
                will be no activity on the construction site.

                After the concrete is cured, the crew applies a waterproofing membrane to the foundation walls; installs
                drains, sewer, and water taps and any plumbing that needs to go into the first-floor slab or basement
                floor; and backfills excavated dirt into the hole around the foundation wall.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>The floor systems, walls and roof systems are completed (collectively known as the shell or skeleton of
                the house). Plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing is applied to the exterior walls and roof
                and windows and exterior doors are installed. The sheathing is then covered with a protective barrier
                known as a house wrap; it prevents liquid water from infiltrating the structure while allowing water
                vapor to escape. This reduces the likelihood of mold and wood rot.</p>

                <li>Sewer Lines and Vents</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Once the shell is finished, siding and roofing can be installed. At the same time, the electrical and
                plumbing contractors start running pipes and wires through the interior walls, ceilings and floors.
                Sewer lines and vents, as well as water supply lines for each fixture, are installed. Bathtubs and
                one-piece shower/tub units are put in place at this point because there’s more room to maneuver large,
                heavy objects.</p>

            <p>Ductwork is installed for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and possibly the
                furnace. HVAC vent pipes are installed through the roof and insulation is installed in the floors, walls
                and ceilings.</p>

            <p>After the roofing goes on, the house is considered “dried in.” An electrician then installs receptacles
                for outlets, lights and switches and runs wires from the breaker panel to each receptacle. Wiring for
                telephones, cable TV and music systems is included in this work.

                Note that HVAC ducts and plumbing are usually installed before wiring because it’s easier to run wires
                around pipes and ducts than vice versa.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fiberglass</li>
                <li>Cellulose</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Insulation plays a key role in creating a more comfortable, consistent indoor climate while significantly
                improving a home’s energy efficiency. One of the most important qualities of insulation is its thermal
                performance or R-value, which indicates how well the material resists heat transfer. Most homes are
                insulated in all exterior walls, as well as the attic and any floors that are located above unfinished
                basements or crawl spaces.</p>

            <p>The most common types of insulation used in new homes are fiberglass, cellulose and foam. Depending on
                the region and climate, your builder may also use mineral wool (otherwise known as rock wool or slag
                wool); concrete blocks; foam board or rigid foam; insulating concrete forms (ICFs); sprayed foam; and
                structural insulated panels (SIPs).</p>

            <p>Blanket insulation, which comes in batts or rolls, is typical in new-home construction. So is loose-fill
                and blown-in insulation, which is made of fiberglass, cellulose or mineral-wool particles. Another
                insulation option, liquid foam, can be sprayed, foamed-in-place, injected or poured. While it costs more
                than traditional batt insulation, liquid foam has twice the R-value per inch and can fill the smallest
                cavities, creating an effective air barrier.</p>

            <P>Fiberglass and mineral-wool batts and rolls are usually installed in side walls, attics, floors, crawl
                spaces, cathedral ceilings and basements. Manufacturers often attach a facing such as kraft paper or
                foil-kraft paper to act as a vapor barrier and/or air barrier. In areas where the insulation will be
                left exposed, such as basement walls, the batts sometimes have a special flame-resistant facing.</P>

            <p>Drywall is hung and taped so the seams between the boards aren’t visible, and drywall texturing (if
                applicable) is completed. The primer coat of paint is also applied after taping is complete. Contractors
                begin installing exterior finishes such as brick, stucco, stone and siding.</p>

            <p>Interior doors, baseboards, door casings, window sills, moldings, stair balusters and other decorative
                trim are installed, along with cabinets, vanities and fireplace mantels and surrounds. Walls get a
                finish coat of paint and are wallpapered where applicable.</p>

            <p>Generally, exterior driveways, walkways and patios are formed at this stage. Many builders prefer to wait
                until the end of the project before pouring the driveway because heavy equipment (such as a drywall
                delivery truck) can damage concrete. But some builders pour the driveway as soon as the foundation is
                completed so that when homeowners visit the construction site, they won’t get their shoes muddy.</p>
